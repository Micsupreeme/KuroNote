# Summary
**A text editor that lets you to set any picture you like as a background!**

With a focus on customisability and intuitiveness, KuroNote is a Notepad-like text editor with personality. It's designed for the quick creation of beautiful notes. Custom theme profiles and optional gamification elements like ranks and achievements make note-writing more enjoyable. You can expect all the essential features like: save as; recent files; print; find; replace; spell check; word wrap; and word count. Additionally, KuroNote offers AES encryption which enables you to password-protect your notes, and a fullscreen mode which does what you think it does.

Version 2.1.0.0 introduced the RTF Mode option; KuroNote can toggle between plain text and rich text procedures for editing, opening/saving files, and copying/pasting text. RTF Mode provides the essential rich text customisation controls, so you can keep using KuroNote even when you need to open or create an ".rtf" file.

*This project is a rebuild of an old VB.NET WinForms project in C# WPF!*
