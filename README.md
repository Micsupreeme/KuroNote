# Summary
**A text editor that allows you to set any picture you like as a background!**

With a focus on customisability and intuitiveness, KuroNote is a Notepad-like text editor with personality. It's designed for the quick creation of beautiful notes. Custom theme profiles and optional gamification elements like ranks and achievements make note-writing more enjoyable. You can expect all the essential features like: save as; print; find; replace; spell check; and word count. Additionally, KuroNote offers AES encryption that enables you to optionally password-protect your notes.
